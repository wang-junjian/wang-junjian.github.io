`提示词`：识别出上面的英语作文

My school life

Happiness in life is about moving forward and growing up. The past three years taught me that there is much to cherish in my school life.

Three years ago, my English was so bad, and every class like a bad dream, in English class I always be silent silence because of my poor English pronunciation. But one day I make a friend his name is H. He was good at English and liked helping other, then he help me to study English and make my English get good.

很好地遵循了指令，只识别了作文，没有多余的信息。

这里它做了一些小的错误纠正：
- `Three years age` 改为 `Three years ago`
- `This Relationship` 改为 `this relationship`

对于分隔不清晰的单词，它会自动识别并分隔，`Allinall,thisrelationshipnotonlyimprovemyEnglishbutalsomakemelearnalot` 识别为 `All in all, this relationship not only improve my English but also make me learn a lot.`。

## 数学

`提示词`：答题

👍 1、6的算术平方根有两个值，一个是正数，一个是负数。正数值是6，负数值是-6。所以正确答案是C。√6表示6的平方根，是一个正数，约等于2.449489742783178。因此，选项D是错误的。

❌ 2、水星的半径约为24400000米，用科学记数法表示为2.44×10^8米。所以正确答案是A。0.244×10^8表示0.244乘以10的8次方，约等于2.44×10^6米，而2.44×10^7表示2.44乘以10的7次方，约等于24.4×10^6米，D选项是错误的。

- 好像直接答题不理想 ❌

```
The underlined parts of the passage suggest that the missing words are present simple tense verbs that describe the actions taking place. Here's a step-by-step guide to finding them:

Look for verbs that describe the actions of the subjects (the narrator, the aunt, and the cousin). These actions include talking, flying, sitting, and looking up.
Consider the context of the sentences. For example, in "While my aunt was talking with my mom at home," the verb talking is present simple because it is an ongoing action.
Identify the verbs that fit the context and the sentence structure. For instance, "We bought two kites and started flying them" implies the action of buying and flying happened simultaneously, so a present simple verb like bought and flying would be appropriate.
Check for verbs that express continuation or progression. For example, "As we were sitting there," the verb sitting is present simple because it is an ongoing action, but it's followed by "Alice looked up at me and said," which indicates a pause or a new action, so the next verb should also be present simple.
Following this process, we can fill in the blanks as follows:

"My aunt came to my home" should be "came" (present simple).
"While my aunt was talking with my mom at home" should be "talking" (present simple).
"my cousin felt a bit boring" should be "bored" (present simple).
"We bought two kites and started flying them" should be "bought" and "flying" (present simple).
"As we were sitting there" should be "sitting" (present simple).
"Alice looked up at me and said" should be "looked up" (past simple, since it's an action directed towards the narrator).
"What a great day today!" should be "said" (past simple, since it's the narrator's reaction to Alice's statement).
With these corrections, the passage should read coherently:

Last Sunday, I had a perfect day! My aunt came to my home. She was talking with my mom at home when my cousin felt a bit bored. So I took Alice to the park near my home. We bought two kites and started flying them. While we were doing that, Alice jumped up and down, and I knew she was truly having great fun. Later, we sat down on a bench and looked at the gardens. As we were sitting there, Alice looked up at me and said, "What a great day today!" I smiled at her and agreed. We did something quite common, yet we were very happy. Many people wait for their "best days." But I think today is our perfect day. As adults, we often make plans carefully in order to have a great day. Some people think that making a lot of money will make them have a nice day. I think we should be more like children. They don't think about money. What will happen tomorrow. They really live in the moment and enjoy the moment! We often hear the expression that we should live in the present. Yesterday is a history. Tomorrow is a mystery. Today is a gift. That's why it's call present. So seize the day!

66. with
67. bored
68. them
69. sat
70. a
71. carefully
72. will make
73. children
74. or
75. is called

解释如下：

66. 根据句子结构，这里需要一个介词来表示“带着”，所以用 "with"。

67. 根据句子结构，这里需要一个形容词来修饰 "a bit"，所以用 "bored"。

68. 根据句子结构，这里需要一个代词来指代 "two kites"，所以用 "them"。

69. 根据句子结构，这里需要一个动词的过去式来表示 "我们坐下来"，所以用 "sat"。

70. 根据句子结构，这里需要一个冠词来修饰 "great day"，所以用 "a"。

71. 根据句子结构，这里需要一个副词来修饰 "make plans"，所以用 "carefully"。

72. 根据句子结构，这里需要一个动词的将来时态来表示 "赚钱会让他们过上美好的一天"，所以用 "will make"。

73. 根据句子结构，这里需要一个名词的复数形式来表示 "像孩子们一样"，所以用 "children"。

74. 根据句子结构，这里需要一个连词来连接 "money" 和 "what will happen tomorrow"，所以用 "or"。

75. 根据句子结构，这里需要一个动词的被动语态来表示 "这就是为什么它被称为 '现在'"，所以用 "is called"。
