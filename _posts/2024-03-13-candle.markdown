A skier slides down a frictionless slope of height 40m and length 80m. What's the skier speed at the bottom?

Solution:
The potential energy of the skier is converted into kinetic energy as it slides down the slope. The formula for potential energy is mgh, where m is mass, g is acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s^2), and h is height. Since there's no friction, all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy at the bottom of the slope. The formula for kinetic energy is 1/2mv^2, where v is velocity. We can equate these two formulas:
mgh = 1/2mv^2
Solving for v, we get:
v = sqrt(2gh)
Substituting the given values, we get:
v = sqrt(2*9.8*40) = 28 m/s
Therefore, the skier speed at the bottom of the slope is 28 m/s.
