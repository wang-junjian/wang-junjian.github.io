### OpenAI API
```python
from openai import OpenAI
import os

TOGETHER_API_KEY = os.environ.get("TOGETHER_API_KEY")

client = OpenAI(
  api_key=TOGETHER_API_KEY,
  base_url='https://api.together.xyz/v1',
)

chat_completion = client.chat.completions.create(
  messages=[
    {
      "role": "system",
      "content": "You are an expert travel guide.",
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Tell me fun things to do in San Francisco.",
    }
  ],
  model="mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1"
)

print(chat_completion.choices[0].message.content)
```
```
 Absolutely, I'd be happy to help you discover some fun things to do in San Francisco! Here are a few suggestions:

1. **Explore Golden Gate Park:** This urban park is larger than New York's Central Park and offers a variety of activities. You can visit the California Academy of Sciences, stroll through the Japanese Tea Garden, or rent a bike and ride around the park.

2. **Ride a Cable Car:** San Francisco's cable car system is a National Historic Landmark. It's not only a fun way to get around, but also offers great views of the city.

3. **Visit Fisherman's Wharf:** Here, you can see sea lions at Pier 39, visit the Aquarium of the Bay, or explore the various shops and restaurants. Don't forget to try some fresh seafood!

4. **Explore the Mission District:** This vibrant neighborhood is known for its colorful murals, hip bars, and delicious Mexican food.

5. **Hike in Muir Woods:** Just a short drive from the city, you can find yourself among some of the oldest and tallest trees in the world.

6. **Visit Alcatraz:** Take a ferry to this infamous island and tour the former prison. Be sure to book your tickets in advance as they sell out quickly.

7. **Stroll around the Ferry Building Marketplace:** This is a food lover's paradise with a wide variety of local food and artisan stalls.

Remember, San Francisco is a city with many microclimates, so be prepared for changing weather throughout the day! Enjoy your visit!

告诉我在旧金山可以做的有趣的事情。
```
```
当然，我很乐意帮助您发现旧金山的一些有趣的事情！ 以下是一些建议：

1. **探索金门公园：** 这个城市公园比纽约中央公园还要大，提供各种各样的活动。 您可以参观加州科学院，漫步日本茶园，或租一辆自行车绕公园骑行。

2. **乘坐缆车：** 旧金山的缆车系统是国家历史地标。 这不仅是一种有趣的出行方式，而且还可以欣赏城市的美景。

3. **参观渔人码头：** 在这里，您可以在39号码头观看海狮，参观海湾水族馆，或探索各种商店和餐馆。 别忘了尝试一些新鲜的海鲜！

4. **探索教会区：** 这个充满活力的街区以其色彩缤纷的壁画、时尚的酒吧和美味的墨西哥美食而闻名。

5. **在穆尔森林徒步旅行：** 距城市仅一小段车程，您就会发现自己置身于世界上一些最古老、最高的树木之中。

6. **参观恶魔岛：** 乘坐渡轮前往这座臭名昭著的岛屿并参观前监狱。 请务必提前预订门票，因为门票很快就会售完。

7. **在渡轮大厦市场漫步：** 这里是美食爱好者的天堂，有各种各样的当地美食和工匠摊位。

请记住，旧金山是一座拥有多种微气候的城市，因此请做好应对全天天气变化的准备！ 祝您访问愉快！

### [REST API](https://docs.together.ai/docs/inference-rest)
```python
# Set up environment if you saved the API key in a .env file
from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv
_ = load_dotenv(find_dotenv())

# Set up the together.ai API key
import os
together_api_key = os.getenv('TOGETHER_API_KEY')

# define the together.ai API url
url = "https://api.together.xyz/inference"

# Store keywords that will be passed to the API
headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {together_api_key}",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"}

# Choose the model to call
model="togethercomputer/llama-2-7b-chat"

prompt = """
Please write me a birthday card for my dear friend, Andrew.
"""

# Add instruction tags to the prompt
prompt = f"[INST]{prompt}[/INST]"

# Set temperature and max_tokens
temperature = 0.0
max_tokens = 1024

data = {
    "model": model,
    "prompt": prompt,
    "temperature": temperature,
    "max_tokens": max_tokens
}

import requests
response = requests.post(url,
                         headers=headers,
                         json=data)

print('[INPUT]\n', data)
print('[OUTPUT]\n', response.json()['output']['choices'][0]['text'])
```
```
[INPUT]
 {'model': 'togethercomputer/llama-2-7b-chat', 'prompt': '[INST]\nPlease write me a birthday card for my dear friend, Andrew.\n[/INST]', 'temperature': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 1024}
[OUTPUT]
   Of course, I'd be happy to help you write a birthday card for your dear friend Andrew! Here's a suggestion:

Dear Andrew,

Happy birthday to an amazing friend! 🎉
